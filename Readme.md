# 📰 Fake News Detection using LSTM (NLP-Based)

This project focuses on detecting **fake news articles** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network. It uses deep learning to classify news as either *real* or *fake* based on its textual content.
